            <p>My coding experience at university is mostly in C++ and Python.
                I have some web-programming experience from a summer internship.</p>
            <p>I expect this course to give an introduction to the basic and most essential aspects of web-programming,
                and that by the end i'll be able to start creating my own web pages.</p>
