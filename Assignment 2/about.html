            <p>My coding experience at university is mostly in C++ and Python.
                I have some web-programming experience from a summer internship.</p>
            <p>I expect this course to give an introduction to the basic and most essential aspects of web-programming,
                and that by the end i'll be able to start creating my own web pages.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The more specific a styling is to an element, the higher precedency it has and thus it will override others.
                    As inline style is written on the element it is considered more specific to the element than others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ids should be used for elements that you want to have a unique styling, while classes should be used for
                    when you want to give a certain type of styling to multiple elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    RGBA stands for Red Blue Green Alpha and it is the combination of red, blue and green color
                    represented by values 0 - 255 as well as opaqueness (alpha) represented by values 0 - 1.
                    The values for red green and blue signifies "brightness"
                    and different combinations of these can recreate practicaly any color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The head element is where meta-information about the document is gathered and processed
                    before the content of the body is loaded. Therefore the body content will be loaded with the correct styling.
