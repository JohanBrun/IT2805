            <p class="section-paragraph">
                The client for this project is the choir group Pirum Old Boys or POB for short, represented by myself, Johan Brun.
                POB is a choir group established in 1977 and its members are mostly former members of the choir group UKEkoret Pirum.
                The choir usually performs around six concerts during the student organized festival UKA.
                Although UKA is a student festival, the singers in POB are of all ages and some have been active since the 80s.

            <p class="section-paragraph">
                This website is meant to be a collection of both practical and fun information about POB.
                Its audience is similar to the members of POB itself, that is anything from students to pensioners.
                Considering the wide spectrum of people visiting, a primary goal should be making the website easy to navigate and to read its contents.

                These are the applications of JavaScript that will be used to improve the experience of the website.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Modularity of navbar. In order to avoid repeated html code on each page, the navbar will be generated by JavaScript.
                    This will be accomplished by adding a container element in the html with id=navbar where the navbar is supposed to by,
                    and then adding its content in the JavaScript function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Animation of timeline. The timeline should be animated to react as the user scrolls down and up it.
                    This will be accomplished by comparing the scrollposition to positions of the elements that make up the timeline,
                    and then animating them by changing their styling with JavaScript.
