				<h2 class="section-title">The Client</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
						The client for this project is the choir group Pirum Old Boys or POB for short, represented by myself, Johan Brun.
						POB is a choir group established in 1977 and its members are mostly former members of the choir group UKEkoret Pirum.
						The choir usually performs around six concerts during the student organized festival UKA.
						Although UKA is a student festival, the singers in POB are of all ages and some have been active since the 80s.

				<h2 class="section-title">Purpose and Goals</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
					This web page is meant to be a destination for all things POB related, being a unified platform for information about the choir itself and its shows.
					Anyone visiting should be able to find out when the next concert will be should find information about this.
					If someone is unsure if they want to see POB they should get an impression of what a concert is like.
					Fans of POB should find links to social media platforms, entertaining content and information about how to book POB for events.

				<h2 class="section-title">Audience</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
						The audience for this page is, aptly named, the audience at POB concerts. This audience can be tech-savy students, working adults or people above the age of 80.
						Students are the most common audience at shows and so they should be able to find when and where they can go to see POB perform.
						They might also be interested in joining POB as its members are all intially students, therefore the prosess of joining POB should be explained clearly.
						With special concern for its older visitors, the page should be very easy and intuitive to navigate, as well as apply universal design so that it is easy to read for people with poor eyesight.
						To convince anyone who might be unsure if they want to go to a show, there should be photos and videos that show how fun it is.
						Any of these might be interested in booking POB for events like partys, conferences, festivals or any others that need entertainment.
						Therefore the information for booking POB should be easy to find, presented in a professional way, but the content surrounding it should reflect the charming nature of POB.
