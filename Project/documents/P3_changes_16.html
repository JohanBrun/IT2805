				<h2 class="section-title">The Client</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
						The client for this project is the choir group Pirum Old Boys or POB for short, represented by myself, Johan Brun.
						POB is a choir group established in 1977 and its members are mostly former members of the choir group UKEkoret Pirum.
						The choir usually performs around six concerts during the student organized festival UKA.
						Although UKA is a student festival, the singers in POB are of all ages and some have been active since the 80s.

        <h2 class="section-title">Design changes</h2>
        A general change for the entire design is the font used which now is Palatino Linotype due to it matching the aestetic of the page better.
        In addition a common footer for every page has not yet been implemented which is why it is not seen on the pages.
        <h3>Navbar</h3>
        <p>
          As a good png option for the logo was not found, the logo was not included this time. Otherwise the font, and font size were changes for aestetics.
        </p>
        <h3>home.html</h3>
        <p>
          The home/start page follows its general design fairly closely.
          The photo used for the cover is changed into one that leaves more space for the title (not overlapping with backlights)
          which gives better readability.
          The background color for the information section below the cover had been changed to be the off-black background-color #0D0D0D
          for both better readability and sleeker design.
        </p>
        <h3>history.html</h3>
        <p>
          The history page has so far been implemented according to its design,
          except the expanded bubbles which now have a greater horizontal radius.
        </p>
        <h3>members.html</h3>
        <p>
          The orginization of the voice groups where changed from columns to rows because it made for better responsive design
          and left less empty space on the page. Otherwise the general concept is the same, although photos of every member and
          information about them is still missing.
        </p>
        <h3>gallery.html</h3>
        <p>
          The original 150x150 pixel resolution was discared in favor of every photo having 200px height and width according to their original shape.
          The height was increased to 200px to make the photos easier to see.
          The title was placed at the center of the page due to the gallery not having collapsable sections yet.
        </p>
        <h3>booking.html</h3>
        <p>
          The booking page was implemented according to its layout, but the background-color for the text was replaced with the off-black for better readability and aestetic.
          The text was also centered vertically on the page.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Minimum requirements</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
          As this was a one man project, all minimum requirements were implemented by Johan.
          The minimum requirements where fulfilled by implementing the rendering and animation of the timeline in HTML5 canvas,
          as well as dynamically generating the member and gallery photos through javascript.

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Modularity</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
          Again all modularity was implemented by Johan. In this project the navbar was made modular through javascript.
          The CSS code was also modular as the web page had one common stylesheet.
