				<h2 class="section-title">The Client</h2>
				<p class="section-paragraph">
          The client for this project is the choir group Pirum Old Boys or POB for short, represented by myself, Johan Brun.
          POB is a choir group established in 1977 and its members are mostly former members of the choir group UKEkoret Pirum.
          The choir usually performs around six concerts during the student organized festival UKA.
          Although UKA is a student festival, the singers in POB are of all ages and some have been active since the 80s.

				<p class="section-paragraph">
          The questionnaire sent out to testers included some yes/no questions if they found information that the site intends to convey.
          In addition a more qualitative question about how much they feel the site shows the experience of a POB concert,
          as well as a field for improvement suggestions.

				<p class="section-paragraph">
          In order to reach the relevant audience, I asked current and former members of POB to test the web page because then I would reach
          a wide age range as well as have the client test the wep page. Two birds, one stone!

				<p class="section-paragraph">
          This project has been a lot of fun to work on. Its really wonderful to see the web page to take shape as each week passed.
          Although the planning and design phases were ardious and at times not as interesting as the coding itself, doing these really payed off
          when the actual coding started as I didn't spend any time wondering what to implement first or how things should look as this were already decided.
          I have also experienced how time consuming different implementations are can be very different from what you expect and that good planning
          probably comes with more experience. When it comes to loading images it was really worth the work of downscaling the images in the gallery for
          the quick loading, and I really hope that I will be able to implement laoding the full scale images in a smart way.<br>

          In this project I spent a lot of time trying to implement some fun functionalities, some of which I was not able to complete in this time frame,
          forcing me to stop at some halfway solutions. I also was not able to get all the content I wanted for the web page (e.g. information about history,
          members, etc.) and would have benefited from involving the client more.
