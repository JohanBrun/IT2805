                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The client for this project is the choir group Pirum Old Boys or POB for short, represented by myself, Johan Brun.
                    POB is a choir group established in 1977 and its members are mostly former members of the choir group UKEkoret Pirum.
                    The choir usually performs around six concerts during the student organized festival UKA.
                    Although UKA is a student festival, the singers in POB are of all ages and some have been active since the 80s.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    This website is meant to be a collection of both practical and fun information about POB.
                    Its audience is similar to the members of POB itself, that is anything from students to pensioners.
                    Considering the wide spectrum of people visiting, a primary goal should be making the website easy to navigate and to read its contents.

                <h2 class="section-title">Navigation Structure</h2>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The navigation structure will be a clique structure. Any part of the webpage should be able to access all the others.
                    This structure is chosen in order to make navigation as simple as possible, and make it very fast an simple to access content.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The webpage will be designed with universal design in mind in order to make it as accessable as possible.
                    Therefore the layout has been structured in a clear way with a navigation bar at the top of the page, content in the middle and a footer at the bottom.
                    Colors are chosen which allow for good contrast and readability.
                    The background color is a black which resembles the background color for POBs regular concert venue at UKA.
                    The rest of the color scheme is made up of shades of green and a white.
                    Green has been chosen because it has been used by POB before.
                </p>

                    Color scheme found on color.adobe.com
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The font used for the page will be Georgia.
                    Another important note is that as many of the photos used in this webpage will be taken by fotogjengen at Samfundet,
                    it is important to credit them for their photos.
                    The appearance of the page is supposed to be clean and somewhat professional looking to reflect the quality of music and show
                    that is delivered by POB.

                    <p>
                        The homepage is the first page the visitors arrive at.
                        It present a group photo which takes up the entire width of the page.
                        The footer will provide some information about who and what POB is.
                        The navbar at the top of the page will be the same for all pages.
                        It has a highlight over the current page in order to tell the user where they are.
                        It should also be possible to click the logo to go to the homepage (note: hopefully the logo can be remade with a transparent backgroun).

                    <p>
                        The history page will attempt to give the interested reader some additional information about how POB came to be,
                        and what POB has done througout the years.
                        The reader will be presented with a timeline with circles along it. Each bubble represents a piece of information
                        and if possible a photo which will be shown when the user scrolls to this bubble.
                        In order to teach the user this behavior, the page will load right above the first bubble so that the moment the user scrolls,
                        the bubble expands.
                        This interactve behavior is implemented in order to make the otherwise boring activity of reading hisotry into something fun.

                        The members will be organized in their respective voice groups and each member will have a portrait,
                        their name and some fun and or interesting information about them. This can include the amount of times they have participated at UKA,
                        when they joined POB or how many years they have been a part of POB.

                        The photos will be organized in groups which can be hidden and shown by clicking the arrow next to the title of the group.
                        The photos will be loaded in a 150px by 150px format in order to speed up load times.
                        If the user clicks on a photo then the photo will be loaded in full size and displayed over the rest of the gallery.

                            Modularity of navbar. In order to avoid repeated html code on each page, the navbar will be generated by JavaScript.
                            This will be accomplished by adding a container element in the html with id=navbar where the navbar is supposed to by,
                            and then adding its content in the JavaScript function.

                            This will be accomplished by comparing the scrollposition to positions of the elements that make up the timeline,
                            and then animating them by changing their styling with JavaScript.
